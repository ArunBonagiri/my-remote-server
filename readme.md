## Quick overview:
    By using java sockets we builded a my_remote application. It devide into two parts
     
         1) server (my-remote-server)
         2) client (my-remote-client)


    this current repo contains all the source of server
    you can find client repo here()
	
	
## 	Server (my-remote-server):
 
    It was totally built on java core library's. So you don't need extra dependencies 
	except this nircmd.exe file you can find here ( http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html )
	because it allows to perform some simple opertions on a machine easily.
